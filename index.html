      <h1>Jujube Li</h1>
      <p> <em>Founder & CEO of <strong> <a href="https://www.BodyDoubler.com">BodyDoubler</a> </strong> </em></p>
      <p>Experienced entrepreneur and innovator, Jujube currently leads Travelite360 Inc. in envisioning and redesigning a more sustainable future for travelers by applying artificial intelligence to the intersection of travel, apparel and carbon
        emissions reduction. Travelite360 is revolutionizing apparel retail with AI-empowered SaaS platform BodyDoubler.
        <br><br>
        Prior to BodyDoubler, Jujube solo-founded an eponymous sustainable apparel brand and pioneered the modular apparel design system. Modular apparel design reduces raw material consumption and storage space exponentially by turning whole
        garments into separate modules within a collection that can be effortlessly mixed and matched to one another to form an exponential number of silhouettes. All her designs were locally manufactured using hand selected EU eco-certified
        textiles. In less than a year of launching the label's e-commerce site, Jujube successfully debuted her eco collections on the runway and launched the label's first brick-and-mortar retail operations at both high-end Japanese department store
        Parco and in Singapore's prime shopping district.
        <br><br>
        Jujube is skilled in Entrepreneurship, Corporate Sustainability & Innovation, Life Cycle Analysis, Project Management, Apparel Retail, and Product Design.
